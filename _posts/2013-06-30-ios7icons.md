It has been a while since my last post. So this time I wanted to do something different than usual. Let's talk about design today.

The iOS operating system is on it's way and to celebrate this I have done some work on the new icons.

I really admire **Jony Ive** work and this is just a sum of my design observations. I have notice that the new icons have a lack of consistency in their design (sorry). This is my attempt of correcting this.

Here are the change I've made:

<div class="center border-bottom">

</div>

<br>

First I change all gradient directions for dark top to lighter bottom. This way we maintain consistency on all icons. Ive have used some transparency and I also kept that in this example.

Now let's take a look on the original icons:
