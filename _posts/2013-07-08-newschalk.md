Hello everyone, today I am going to talk about [Newschalk](http://www.newschalk.com) an effortless newsreader that I have been working on it with my friend Garindra Prahandono. Me and Gary started this project back in 2010 and stop the development because of work. Since Google announced the **Google Reader shutdown** we became again interested in bringing this project to life. 

The first version uses [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) to aggregate your favorite news. The next step is transform the application into a **social news hub** where you can be followed and follow interesting people and know what are they reading.

Here a small video preview:

I am happy to announce that **Newschalk** is [live](http://www.newschalk.com) and almost ready for use. Right now we are working on invitation basis. [Request your invitation](http://www.newschalk.com) today and change the way you read news.

We have huge plans for this project and hope everyone enjoys using it.
