Hello, my name is **Mariz Melo**. I am from Brazil. Currently living in San Jose - California and working in Mountain View. I am trying to get **xchema** up and running for next summer. The name is the same as my previous start up company which I opened in Brazil together with my dear friends **Ricardo Amaral** and **Marcelo Vasconcelos**.
    
This blog is an attempt to keep a diary about projects, knowledge base (I keep forgetting things), and a bookmark for useful discoveries around the web.

Tools used to make this blog:

1. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (on github pages)
2. [xtyle](http://xtyle.xchema.com) design framework made by [xchema](http://xchema.com)
3. **xmaker** visual web applications builder (coming soon).
