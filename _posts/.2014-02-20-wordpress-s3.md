Today was a very exciting day at work. Some colleagues request access to our corporate website which now runs on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS).

I had three options:

1. Give them access to the EC2 server
2. Give them SFTP access to the file system on EC2
3. Use S3 for static content

I've decided to go with the latest option. 

Why? Well I really did not want people messing around on the production server for the website. Of course with SFTP I could restrict access to only the upload folder on Wordpress, but still, I would have to open the SFTP port and allow external access to a unknown range of IP addresses, and that is just not good.

Here is a diagram with my basic setup for the website:
