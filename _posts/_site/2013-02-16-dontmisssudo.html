<p>Sometimes you are in your terminal and need to type a command that requires you to have root powers. Well I don&#8217;t know you, but I sometimes forget to put sudo in front of those commands. Look at this example:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm somefile
rm: somenewfile: Permission denied</code></pre>

<p>I have some options here. I could retype the entire command or use arrow up and go to the beginning of the line adding &#8220;sudo&#8221; to it. But a better way to fix my mistake is using the operator &#8220;!!&#8221;. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm somefile
rm: somenewfile: Permission denied
$ sudo !!
$ sudo rm newfile </code></pre>

<p>Amazing, your file &#8220;newfile&#8221; is now removed. Enjoy.</p>
